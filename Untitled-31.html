            <h3>project No.1: Snake Game</h3>
            <p>With older Nokia phones, we had an old-age addiction with the snake game. But of course, we don’t have it anymore. 
                What if you could write one for yourself using Python? Beginner Python programmers who are interested in making
                 something easier in their domain can definitely try this out, and the module Turtle was built specifically for 
                 beginners to try and submit as part of the project. The project will be done in Python 3.

            <h3>project No.2:  Contact List</h3>
            <p>As old school as it may sound, creating a contact list, adding contacts along with phone numbers or emails, and editing
                 them, are still prevalent. To create one, you can use the SQLAlchemy library which uses SQLite to store contacts. Your
                 contact book application should be organized into modules and packages, and you should give it a coherent structure.
                 In order to get the most out of this project, some previous experience with Python and PyQt programming would be helpful.
                 As a result, you will need to know the following:
                 <li>Develop GUI applications with PyQt and Python</li>
                 <li>Use Python and PyQt to manage SQL databases</li>
                 <li>Working with SQLite databases</li>

            <h3>project No.3: Website Blocker</h3>
            <p>Aren’t we all tired of random pop-ups during site surfing? So, we can create website blockers for restraining pushy ads
                 by creating this Python project. A website blocker prevents access to websites permanently or on a schedule. We can
                  block all websites from unwanted categories so that we can use the internet safely.
                <br>
                So, the Website Blocker Python project’s goal is to block websites from any device. By blocking websites from the 
                user’s device, this project will help them stay away from distractions as they will not be able to open them.
                <br>
                How do we do it?
                <br>
                A host file is part of every operating system. Operating systems may have different locations for the host file.
                It maps the hostname to the IP address of the machine. Here, we list the websites we want to block.

            <h3>project No.4: Voice Assistant</h3>
            <p>
                Looking at the market majorly, we realise voice assistants are all up to take over our tasks. Siri, Alexa, and OkGoogle
                 are already leading the market. How about you have a personal assistant of your own.
                <br>
                Python is, as we all know, an excellent language for scriptwriters and developers. Let’s create a script for Voice 
                Assistant using Python. The assistant can be manipulated according to the user’s needs.
                <br>
                Modules needed for this project:
                <br>
                Subprocesses,WolframAlpha,Pyttsx3,Tkinter,Wikipedia,Speech Recognition,Web browser,Ecapture,Pyjokes,Datetime,Twilio,
                Requests,BeautifulSoup.

            <h3>project No.5:  Password Generator</h3>
            <p>
                The most difficult part of managing multiple accounts is generating a different strong password for each.
                 A strong password is a mix of alphabets, numbers, and alphanumeric characters. Therefore, the best use of Python could be 
                 building a project where you could generate random passwords for any of your accounts.
                <br>
                 In order to create a strong password, users can use this password generator to generate a random and customized password.
