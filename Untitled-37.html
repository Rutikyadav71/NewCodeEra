            <h3>project No.1: Password Generator using Java</h3>
            <p>With the growing trend of hacking attacks, everyone should create different and complex passwords for their 
                diverse accounts to keep them secure. Remembering every password is not humanly possible and noting it down 
                somewhere is not a wise idea. Hence, people take the help of Password generators to create strong and complex 
                passwords for their accounts. To generate such functionality all by yourself, you can take advantage of the
                function that java offers. Whenever a user is developing an account on a new website, you can use that program
                to develop a password. To take the safety of the password a notch above, you can enforce such functionality so
                that it saves passwords in encrypted form. To incorporate this, you need to study the fundamentals of Cryptography 
                and Java Cryptography Architecture.

            <h3>project No.2: Online Survey System</h3>
            <p>The idea of this project is to create a core java project that can accumulate the viewpoint of a targeted
                audience of a survey through the Internet. Based on that, the app can send the targeted audiences promotional 
                emails and can launch online surveys. Any business can make use of this type of software to assemble feedback 
                regarding the services or products they offer. We can build such functionality so that only registered customers
                can cast their responses. The main attributes of the app should be:
                <br>
                    <li>The apps are programmed in a way that they should be compatible with various databases like SQL and NoSQL.</li>
                    <li>Customers can submit their reactions anonymously.</li>
                    <li>Should be installed at a doable cost.</li>

            <h3>project No.3: Snake Game using Java</h3>
            <p>In our childhood, nearly all of us enjoyed playing classic snake games. Now we will try to enhance it with the help 
                of Java concepts. The concept appears to be easy but it is not that effortless to implement.

                One ought to comprehend the OOPs concept in detail to execute this effectively. Furthermore, ideas from Java Swing
                are used to create this application. The application should comprise the following functionalities:
                <li>The Snake will have the ability to move in all four directions.</li>
                <li>The snake's length grows as it eats food.</li>
                <li>When the snake crosses itself or strikes the perimeter of the box, the game is marked over.</li>
                <li>Food is always given at different positions.</li>

            <h3>project No.4: Electricity Billing System</h3>
            <p>
                This java project is a contemporary take on the classic electricity billing system where a person gathers data from
                our electricity meter. The primary objective of this project is to automate the entire process to make it seamless,
                convenient, and effective. The software can compute the bill amount on the basis of units of electricity consumed 
                in a month. Electricity Billing System is considered one of the best java project ideas for beginners. The app should
                have the below-mentioned features:
                <li>Accurately calculate the bill amount.</li>
                <li>Instantaneous sharing of data between local electricity offices and users.</li>
                <li>Extremely safe to negate the chances of tampering.</li>

            <h3>project No.5: Web Medical Management System</h3>
            <p>
                The undertaking is called a “Virtual Medicine Home.” By using this application, patients can reserve online meetings 
                with their preferred specialists. Specialists can recommend medical services, e-remedy, and consider the patient’s 
                clinical records, lab reports, and many more. The app also lets users explore and interface with individuals who are
                donating their organs or blood. During the times of the pandemic, when it gets dangerous to visit the hospital, this
                JAVA project comes to your rescue. The application comes with two modules — an Admin and a Doctor module. The Admin
                module is responsible for the online programming framework, and the Doctor module allows specialists to communicate
                with patients.
