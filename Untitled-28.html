            <h3>project No.1:  A Chatbot for Students</h3>
            <p>This PHP project lets the bot analyze the user’s messages and the replies to the questions are sent accordingly. 
                This web app can be utilized to respond to the queries of the students. You can create a college query bot of sorts
                 thereby making it easier for the students. With artificial intelligence, the chatbot will be able to analyze the 
                 questions of the users efficiently and will provide appropriate responses. If the chatbot is incapable to provide 
                 suitable responses to the query of the user, then they can give feedback to enhance the accuracy. For this project, 
                 you get to implement the knowledge you have of PHP, UI, and AI for this project.

            <p>APHP has many diverse abilities, and you can utilize them when working on this project. You can create a portal where
                 various patients and doctors can interact. Patients can make use of this portal to schedule appointments on the portal
                  according to the availability of the doctors. This is a very impressive yet exceptional PHP project that you can work 
                  on. This portal tackles the hassle of the tedious process of appointment booking. Doctors can also handle their 
                  appointments on this portal at their convenience. You can also incorporate additional features for the doctors like
                   the portal creates the possibility for the doctors to incorporate the medical records of the patient into the

            <h3>project No.3: Product Rating System as per the Consumer Reviews</h3>
            <p>You may have come across various product rating systems prevalent in many famous and famous e-Commerce platforms.
                 These systems highlight the average ratings of the reviews provided by the users, making it easy for a visitor to
                  comprehend what the favored opinion on a particular product is. This is a suitable solution where the user experience 
                  is improved, at the same time, the company can look for new ways to serve the customers better. The rating system you
                   are creating will require an algorithm to keep a track and handle the customer reviews. Also, you can mine and match
                    certain keywords present in the reviews with your database for opinion mining. Additionally, you can design a 
                    sentiment analyzing solution, it will look for few keywords in the reviews of users to learn whether it is good
                     or bad.

             Just like how the ad dispenser project mentioned above exhibits advertisements, this project should involve a database that suggests
             movie recommendations. The software should be able to make movie recommendations to customers on the grounds of what they have seen
             in the past. Take the example of a movie streaming platform like Netflix that offers customized experiences to subscribers.

            <p>
                In this project, you will be creating a clothes recommendation system. You will be utilizing PHP to create a suggestion
                 that can be employed for an online clothing store. The solution you are creating can capture user data in the items
                  they’ve eyed, items in their wishlist, and the last purchases to suggest the consumer’s related products. Collective 
                  filtering can be used to offer suggestions that are correct as well as effective as they can determine the similarities
                   between different users. These kinds of suggestion systems are very famous and are seen in many e-Commerce stores.
                    Amazon’s recommendation system is considered the most powerful and efficient. You can also take a glance at their
                     system to get encouraged on how to work around this project.
