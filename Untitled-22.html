            <h3>project No.1: Personal Portfolio page</h3>
            <p>You must have a strong understanding of HTML5 and CSS3 in order to build a personal portfolio page.
                The basic information for a work portfolio, such as your name and image, projects, specialised talents,
                and interests, will be included on the web page you make for this project. If you'd like, you may also
                host the entire portfolio on GitHub using your GitHub account and include your resume.
                <br>
                A header and footer section should be present on the portfolio page. A menu highlighting your contact
                details,
                employment history, and personal information will be included in the header area. You can provide a
                brief
                description of your professional background and hobbies along with your photo at the top of the page.
                You can
                add a few work samples after this summary.

            <h3>project No.2: Event page</h3>
            <p>You can try your hand at this simple DIY as well! It will entail building a static page that displays
                information
                about an event (conference, webinar, product launch, etc.). For this project, HTML and CSS are both
                required.
                It can be considered as one of the best HTML and CSS projects for beginners.
                <br>
                The event page will have a straightforward design. The schedule, the event location, and the speakers'
                names and
                photographs with links will all be in the header section. A section describing the event's goal,
                including who the
                event is for and whose audience group it is intended to reach, must also be included. To make the page
                look clean,
                divide it into smaller sections. Select the appropriate background colour, font style, and color for
                each component
                of the page.

            <h3>project No.3: A Simple Webpage with Animation</h3>
            <p>One of the finest methods to increase the interaction and appeal of a web page is through animation. A
                web page with
                certain animations can be made as an HTML project. GIFs and photos can be used to provide animation
                effects to a
                website.
                <br>
                Typically, CSS and JavaScript are used to create the basic animations that we see on many websites.
                However, you may
                use HTML to create a web page and add a few basic animations to it in order to learn more about the
                markup language's
                potential.

            <h3>project No.4: Technical documentation page </h3>
            <p>
                A technical documentation page can be made if you are comfortable with the foundations of HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript.
                The primary objective of this project is to create a page of technical documentation where users can
                click on any topic
                on the left side of the page and have the appropriate content load on the right.
                <br>
                There is nothing extravagant about the project; it is just a simple, straightforward page of technical
                documentation.
                To build this HTML project, you must divide the webpage into two parts. On the right side will be the
                documentation
                (description) for each topic, and on the left side will be a menu listing each topic in alphabetical
                order. The click
                function can be added using Javascript or CSS bookmarks.

            <h3>project No.5: News website</h3>
            <p>
                You would find it difficult to build a news website using HTML since you need to add numerous parts and
                style them with
                CSS.
                <br>
                To obtain a clear sense of the sections you can include to your news website, and you should first
                browse through
                well-known news websites like CNN, Huffington Post, and BBC News. You must segment the news when
                building the website
                into different parts based on genres like politics, sports, entertainment, etc. Additionally, you must
                provide excerpts
                and pictures from the most recent news in each area.
                <br>
                A news website should ideally feature a header area that prominently displays the domain name and a menu
                that lets users
                browse various categories.
